# 🎯 Event Delegation in JavaScript

Event Delegation is a powerful **JavaScript event-handling pattern** where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, you attach a **single event listener to a parent element**. This parent listens for events that bubble up from its children.

---

## 📌 What is Event Delegation?

* Event delegation takes advantage of **event bubbling** in JavaScript.
* When an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent.
* We can capture the event on the parent and determine which child triggered it using `event.target`.

## 🖼️ Visualization Diagram

```
Parent (UL)
│
├── Child 1 (LI: Laptops)   → Click bubbles up to parent
├── Child 2 (LI: Cameras)   → Click bubbles up to parent
└── Child 3 (LI: Shoes)     → Click bubbles up to parent
```

👉 Only **one listener** is attached to `UL`, instead of three listeners on each `LI`.

## ⚡ Quick Demo & Example 1

**HTML:**

```html
<ul id="category">
  <li id="laptops">Laptops</li>
  <li id="cameras">Cameras</li>
  <li id="shoes">Shoes</li>
</ul>
```

**JavaScript:**

```js
document.querySelector("#category").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  console.log(e.target); // The clicked child element
  window.location.href = "/" + e.target.id;
});
```

✅ Clicking on any `<li>` redirects to a new page based on its `id`.

## ⚡ Example 2: Form with Auto Uppercase

**HTML:**

```html
<div id="form">
  <input type="text" id="name" data-uppercase>
  <input type="text" id="pan">
  <input type="text" id="mobile">
</div>
```

**JavaScript:**

```js
document.querySelector("#form").addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  if (e.target.dataset.uppercase !== undefined) {
    e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase();
  }
});
```

✅ Whenever you type inside `#name`, the text automatically becomes uppercase.

## ✅ Benefits of Event Delegation

1. **Performance Optimization** → Fewer event listeners = less memory usage.
2. **Dynamic Elements** → Works for newly added child elements (no need to re-bind).
3. **Cleaner Code** → One parent listener instead of many child listeners.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of Event Delegation

* **Not all events bubble** (e.g., `blur`, `focus`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`).
* **Event.target confusion** → Need to check carefully which element triggered the event.
* **Deep DOM structures** → Might become harder to manage in nested hierarchies.

## 📊 Syntax

```js
parentElement.addEventListener("event", function(e) {
  if (e.target && e.target.matches("childSelector")) {
    // Your logic here
  }
});
```

---

## 📝 Real-Life Use Cases

1. **Navigation menus** → Handle clicks on all menu items using one listener.
2. **Forms** → Validate multiple inputs with a single parent listener.
3. **Dynamic lists (e-commerce, chats)** → Works with elements added later.

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript?

👉 Event Delegation is the technique of handling events by attaching a single listener to a parent element that listens for events bubbling up from child elements.

---

### Q2: Why is Event Delegation useful?

👉 It improves performance, saves memory, and works well with dynamically added elements.

---

### Q3: Which events cannot be delegated?

👉 Events like `blur`, `focus`, `mouseenter`, and `mouseleave` do not bubble and cannot be delegated.

---

### Q4: How do you identify which child triggered the event?

👉 Use `event.target` (the actual element clicked/typed on).

---

### Q5: Give a real-life example of Event Delegation.

👉 In an e-commerce site, instead of attaching click listeners to each product item, attach a single listener to the parent container of products.

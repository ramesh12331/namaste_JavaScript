# ðŸŽ¬ JavaScript Series â€“ Short Conclusion & Summary (English)

## âœ… Episode\_01: call, apply, bind

* **call** â€“ Immediately invokes a function with a specified `this` context.
* **apply** â€“ Similar to call but arguments are passed as an array.
* **bind** â€“ Returns a new function with bound `this`, can be called later.

## âœ… Episode\_02: Currying

* Transform a function into a series of smaller functions taking one argument at a time.
* Improves reusability and customization.

## âœ… Episode\_03: Polyfill for bind

* Implement JavaScriptâ€™s `bind()` method manually.
* Common interview question.

## âœ… Episode\_04: Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance

* **Prototype:** Reference from one object to another.
* **Inheritance:** Objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.

## âœ… Episode\_05: Debouncing

* Ensures a function is called only after a certain period of inactivity.
* Example: Search input suggestions.

## âœ… Episode\_06: Throttling

* Limits a function to run at most once in a given time interval.
* Example: Scroll event optimization.

## âœ… Episode\_07: Debouncing vs Throttling

* **Debounce:** Executes after the last action.
* **Throttle:** Executes at a fixed interval.

## âœ… Episode\_08: Async vs Defer

* **async:** Script loads in parallel and executes immediately when ready.
* **defer:** Script loads in parallel but executes after HTML parsing.

## âœ… Episode\_09: Event Bubbling & Capturing (Trickling)

* **Bubbling:** Event propagates from child to parent.
* **Capturing:** Event propagates from parent to child.

## âœ… Episode\_10: Event Delegation

* Attach a listener to a parent element to handle events on its child elements.
* Efficient and memory-friendly.

## âœ… Episode\_11: sum(1)(2)(3)(4)...(n)()

* Create an infinitely chainable sum function using currying.

## âœ… Episode\_12: Recursive Thinking

* A function calls itself.
* Example: Factorial, Fibonacci series.

## âœ… Episode\_13: Local Storage & Session Storage

* **localStorage:** Persistent data even after browser close.
* **sessionStorage:** Data is cleared when the tab is closed.

# ðŸ“Œ Overall Summary

These 13 episodes cover JavaScript core concepts and advanced topics:

* Function handling (call, apply, bind, currying, polyfills)
* Memory optimization (debounce, throttle, delegation)
* Browser behavior (async, defer, storage APIs)
* Event system (bubbling, capturing, delegation)
* Problem solving (recursion, sum chaining)

ðŸ‘‰ All these concepts are highly useful for machine coding rounds and frontend developer interviews.

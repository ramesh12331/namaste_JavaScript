# JavaScript Execution Context & Call Stack

## ðŸ“Œ What is Execution Context?

* When a JS program runs, a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created.
* It has **2 phases**:

  1. **Memory Creation Phase** â†’ JS allocates memory for variables and functions.
  2. **Code Execution Phase** â†’ JS executes code line by line.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Code

```js
var n = 2;

function square(num) {
  var ans = num * num;
  return ans;
}

var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Memory Creation Phase (GEC)

* `var n` â†’ memory allocated, stores `undefined`.
* `function square` â†’ memory allocated, stores entire function code.
* `var square2` â†’ memory allocated, stores `undefined`.
* `var square4` â†’ memory allocated, stores `undefined`.

âœ… At this stage, nothing is executed yet, only memory reserved.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Code Execution Phase (GEC)

* `n = 2` â†’ assigns `2` to `n`.
* `square2 = square(n)` â†’ calls `square(2)` â†’ creates a **new Function Execution Context (FEC)**.

  * Inside FEC:

    * Memory Phase: `num=undefined`, `ans=undefined`.
    * Execution Phase: `num=2`, `ans=4`, `return 4` â†’ sent back.
* `square4 = square(4)` â†’ another FEC created, executes and returns `16`.

## ðŸ“Œ Function Execution Context (FEC)

Every function call creates its own **Execution Context**:

1. **Memory Phase** â†’ allocate variables inside function.
2. **Execution Phase** â†’ run code, return result.
3. When function finishes â†’ FEC is deleted.

## ðŸ“Œ Call Stack

* JS uses **Call Stack** to manage execution contexts.
* Works on **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**.
* Steps:

  * GEC pushed first.
  * When `square()` called â†’ new FEC pushed.
  * After execution â†’ FEC popped (removed).
  * At the end â†’ GEC popped.

âœ… Call Stack ensures functions are executed in correct order.

ðŸ‘‰ Call Stack is also known as:

* Program Stack
* Control Stack
* Runtime Stack
* Machine Stack
* Execution Context Stack

---

## ðŸ“– Simple Summary

* **Execution Context** = Environment in which JS code runs.
* **Two Phases**:

  * Memory Creation â†’ allocate variables/functions.
  * Code Execution â†’ run code line by line.
* **Function Calls** â†’ create new execution contexts.
* **Call Stack** â†’ manages execution order (push & pop).
* After program ends â†’ GEC removed from call stack.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1. What is an Execution Context in JavaScript?**
ðŸ‘‰ It is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It has two phases: memory creation and code execution.

**Q2. What are the types of Execution Context?**
ðŸ‘‰ Global Execution Context (default) and Function Execution Context (created when a function is called).

**Q3. What happens in the Memory Creation Phase?**
ðŸ‘‰ Variables are initialized with `undefined`, and functions are stored with their definitions.

**Q4. What happens in the Code Execution Phase?**
ðŸ‘‰ JS assigns actual values to variables and executes function calls.

**Q5. What is the Call Stack?**
ðŸ‘‰ A stack data structure that manages the order of execution contexts using LIFO (Last In, First Out).

**Q6. What happens when a function finishes execution?**
ðŸ‘‰ Its execution context is popped from the call stack.

**Q7. Is Call Stack the same as Program Stack?**
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, Call Stack is also known as Program Stack, Control Stack, Runtime Stack, Machine Stack, or Execution Context Stack.
